# Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation

This project is a responsive landing page built as part of the Web Developer Internship at Skill Craft. It features an interactive navigation bar that remains fixed at the top of the screen and changes its appearance as the user scrolls or hovers over menu items.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar stays visible at the top of the viewport, ensuring easy access to all sections of the page.
- **Dynamic Scrolling Effect:** The navigation bar changes its background color and padding when the user scrolls down, creating a clean, modern effect.
- **Hover Effects:** Each menu item is styled with smooth hover effects, providing visual feedback to the user.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the page structure and semantic elements.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including `position: fixed`, `:hover` pseudo-classes, and `@media` queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** For handling the scroll event to trigger dynamic style changes.
